# SpookyRetro
The UNG Game Dev Club Project for 2019

(Thank you to John Archer for compiling all these ideas <3)
Decided:

-    The game will take place in a mostly empty, dilapidated Dahlonega
-    - Part of the game will likely take place in abandoned gold mining tunnels
-    - The General Store will be featured, possibly as a vendor location
-    - The Gold Museum will be featured, possibly as a hub/safe space

-    An incorporeal nemesis will continually follow the player
-    - The nemesis will not be easily visible, its presence will be communicated via some sort of environmental cues (flickering/dying lights, sound design, vignetting, etc.)
-    - At least a small location will be safe from this nemesis
-    - - The safe location will become more threatening over time, possibly becoming less protected against the nemesis

-    The game’s narrative will feature historical elements dating back to the gold rush

-    The game will operate in the narrative genre of Cosmic Horror

-    The game will operate from a first-person perspective in real-time, with visuals based on the graphics of PS1 games.

-    Any local businesses included in the game will have their names changed in all in-game assets and references
Suggested, to be discussed:

-    The game’s narrative will include elements of Native American history/mythology

-    The game will operate with Metroidvania-style progression, with items found/crafted/purchased during the game unlocking gates elsewhere in the game world

-    The game will feature minor enemies of some sort in addition to the nemesis
-    - The game will feature a weapon-based combat system
-    - The minor enemies will be incorporeal entities, humanoids, Silent Hill-style mutants, or some combination thereof

-    The game will feature a crafting system

-    The game will feature vendors
-    - Vendor NPC’s will change over time to become more uncanny and menacing

-    The game will indicate goals via written and visual narrative content in the form of documents found around the game world

-    The game will feature at least one NPC in the form of a fortune-teller style automaton
-    - This NPC will be a vendor and/or source of hints concerning in-game goals

-    The General Store location will serve as a puzzle/gate hub

-    The Smith House location will feature an entrance to the gold mine tunnels

-    Locations will change over time when the player is absent

-    Portions of the game will take place in abstract nightmare-scapes

-    The game will feature a sanity system
-    - At low sanity levels, audiovisual cues will be triggered based on location (voices/whispering or strange visions in certain parts of the game world)

-    Local institutions will be included with in-game elements based on their local cultural significance

Explicit Influences:

Visual:
-    Silent Hill
-    Eldritch (?)

Narrative:
-    H. P. Lovecraft
